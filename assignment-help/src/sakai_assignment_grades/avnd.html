<h2>In Assignments, which method should I use
to link my assignment to the Gradebook?</h2>
<p>In Assignments, instructors have two options for creating an
initial relationship between an assignment and a Gradebook item:</p>

<ul><li>Select <strong><code>Add Assignment to Gradebook</code></strong>.
</li><li>Select <strong><code>Associate with existing Gradebook assignment</code></strong>.
</li></ul>

<p>In general, choosing <strong><code>Add Assignment to Gradebook</code></strong> is the
simplest option because you can enter and edit assignment grades in
one place (in the Assignments tool), and they will display both there
and in the Gradebook.</p>

<p>The recommendation is based on the following issues regarding the
relationship between the Assignments and Gradebook tools:</p>

<h3>Using the Add Assignment to Gradebook option</h3>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<ul><li>You must use the Assignments tool when you want to edit the point
value and due date of an assignment. Also, you must grade assignments
in the Assignments tool.<br /><br />
</li><li>The settings Gradebook retains for this item are <strong><code>Release this
item to Students</code></strong>, <strong><code>Include this item in course grade
calculations</code></strong>, and <strong><code>Category</code></strong> (if you've created
categories).<br /><br />
</li><li>A grade you assign for an individual assignment through the
Assignments tool cannot be overridden in the Gradebook.<br /><br />
</li><li>Grades you assign for an individual assignment do not display in
the Gradebook (even for the instructor) until you release the grades
or return a grade to a student from the Assignments tool. In the
Gradebook, assignment grades will not show up for students if you have
not selected (in the Gradebook) the <strong><code>Release this item to
Students</code></strong> setting.<br /><br />
</li><li>It may be confusing that, after starting with <strong><code>Add Assignment
to Gradebook</code></strong>, you have to use the default <strong><code>Associate with
existing Gradebook assignment</code></strong> setting upon further editing in the
Assignments tool.
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The limitations of using this option are
that you can't use the Gradebook to override an assignment grade, and
you must make any changes to settings, as well as any grade changes,
in the Assignments tool.</p>

<h3>Using the Associate with existing Gradebook assignment option</h3>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<ul><li>You must change the point value and due date settings in both the
Assignments and Gradebook tool (i.e., you must manually synchronize
them).<br /><br />
</li><li>Grades you assign in the Assignments tool do not display in the
Gradebook (even for the instructor) until you release the grades or
return a grade to a student from the Assignments tool. In the
Gradebook, assignment grades will not show up for students if you have
not selected (in the Gradebook) <strong><code>Release this item to
Students</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>A grade you assign for an individual assignment through the
Assignments tool can be overridden in the Gradebook.  However, the
change will not be reflected in the Assignments tool.
<br /><br />
</li><li>If you click <strong><code>Release Grades</code></strong> in the Assignments tool, any
grades you have changed in the Gradebook tool will be overridden by
those in the Assignments tool.
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The biggest disadvantage of using this
option is that if you want to edit settings, you must make the changes
in both the Assignments and Gradebook tool. The advantage is that you
can use the Gradebook to override an assignment grade, though the
change won't be reflected in the Assignments tool.</p>

<h3>Additional issues</h3>

<ul><li>When you import assignments and Gradebook items from another site,
the items in the Gradebook that you created with the <strong><code>Add
Assignment to Gradebook</code></strong> option won't appear in the Gradebook.
You will have to use the Assignments tool to add them again.<br /><br />
</li><li>For imported assignments that you created using the <strong><code>Associate
with existing Gradebook assignment</code></strong> option, you will have to use
the Assignments tool to re-associate them with the appropriate
Gradebook items.
</li></ul>
