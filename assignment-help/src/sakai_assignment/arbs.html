</li><li><strong>Due date:</strong> This is the assignment's deadline. To
list the due date on the course site's schedule, see step 4
below.
</li><li><strong>Accept until:</strong> No assignments can be
submitted after this date. You can set this date and time later than
the due date to continue accepting assignments (e.g., to allow for
revisions) after the due date.
</li><li><strong>Student submissions:</strong> You can choose to have
students submit their assignments inline only (typed directly into a
text box), as attachments only, or both.
</li><li><strong>Grade scale:</strong> You can choose from five grading
options: <strong><code>Ungraded</code></strong>, <strong><code>Letter grade</code></strong>, <strong><code>Points</code></strong>,
<strong><code>Pass/Fail</code></strong>, or <strong><code>Checkmark</code></strong>. If you choose points, enter
the maximum possible points (must be a positive number or zero).

alert message at the top of the page when you post the assignment if
you leave it blank.  Click <strong><code>Post</code></strong> a second time to proceed.</p>
